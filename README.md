============

This repository is my final project in the course Javascript on Blekinge Tekniska Högskola. It is a further development of Triton-base (see info below). 

This project is a community, as well as a showcase for a couple of tools i have developed for this community. 

The project revolves around the possibility to upload videos to a server. Like youtube. 

In order to use the video upload feature, you need to have ffmpeg installed on the server. That is not installed in this project, but a program to install on the server. See more info [here](http://ffmpeg.org). 

Some of the tools also requires [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and [LESS](http://lesscss.org). 

Some folders are expected by the project which does not come with Github because they are empty here. These are: 

* webroot/cache (for image processing)
* webroot/video (for storing videos)
* webroot/video/tmp (for processing videos being stored)

Triton-base
-----------
 
A boilerplate for smaller websites or webbapplications using PHP. Built by Mattias Olsson. 

Triton is a way to keep your code efficient with object oriented PHP and maintain the essentials of OOP - abstraction, encapsulation and inheritance. 
Keep all settings in your config file and let your classes autoload with bootstrap.php. 

Classes are also included for text formatting, image display (resize etc.) and databases with PHP PDO. 

This web template is part of a project at Blekinge Tekniska Högskola.
